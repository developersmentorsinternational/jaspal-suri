# Member's Internation iOS App

Pitch: Mentors International is redesigning their microfinance training. 
The biggest problems are clients forgetting the material between sessions, forgetting to come to trainings, and difficulty taking time to travel to the training. Imagine a chat bot that helps solve these issues. 
MVP: A mentor/trainer can log in and set up a variety of reminders as to the content of the most recent lesson, goal reminders, and the time and location of the next meeting. Mentors can create a profile, and add messages to their profile, and add a list of clients to a messaging group. Once the messages are complete, you'll submit them to be sent to your list of clients throughout the month. Use Twilio (https://www.twilio.com/) to set up the messaging services necessary for your app to send out the reminders. Reminds should be sent via text or WhatsApp.
Stretch Goal: Allow a 2nd user type (board member) to be able to log in and see trainerâ€™s profiles based on an invitation. They can also Create, Read, Update and Delete messages to send client groups.
